## Working Directory Setup using `here()`
Use `here()` to *standardize the working directory between R markdown and
R console* as opposed to using `getwd()` (and `setwd()`), at the slight
inconveniences of importing the `here` library, using `here()` to write file
paths, and manually specify paths for files outside the working directory.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#install.packages('here')
library(here)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
here()
```



## R Markdown tips (delete later)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Importing the data

```{r}

# equivalent to read.csv("../data/data_path)
data_path = "envDataset_12h_10x10_with_mask.csv"
data = read.csv(here("..", "data", data_path))

```


```{r}
#str(data)
```
